Used my information but the repositories are not same as I have created on github.
Used bootstrap and google fonts other than html, css and javascript.
For repos information, I have created an array of objects to store the infomation and place it in script.js file.
This project is responsive as it can be viewed in any device properly and I have used media queries for that.
